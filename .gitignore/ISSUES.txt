I updated Unity to 2.5, installed Audacity and Photoshop, linked SourceTree to my github repository, and I've encountered no issues getting these programs to run.

A couple things I noticed while I was doing the process on a separate computer today, however:

-It seems that, after Unity 2018.1, Unity discontinued their integration of MonoDevelop, so everyone will have to have some
external IDE moving forward. This might explain why some people couldn't follow along in class today.

-After having no issues on my laptop, I tried updating to Unity 2.5f on a second computer. Apparently, Unity removed this verson from their website within the last few days. Anyone lagging behind might be forced onto Unity 2.7 for this reason.

Cheers.
